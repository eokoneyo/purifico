Docker Toolbox for Nodejs Post-mortem debugging, comes with `lldb`, `perf` and `llnode`

This project is heavily inspired by the works of [Howard Hellyer](https://github.com/hhellyer) and [Brendan Gregg](https://github.com/brendangregg)

### Setup

- Copy the core dump and node binary executable specific to the process that generated the core dump into a cloned copy of this repo (see llnode issue [#74](https://github.com/nodejs/llnode/issues/74))

- Start the container
    ```bash
      ./bin/start_disposable.sh
    ```

- To use `findjsobjects` and other similar commands, a memory ranges file must be generated. Simply run `./set_memoryranges.sh` within the container and follow the prompt.
